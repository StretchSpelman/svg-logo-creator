## Logo Generator Tool
# Overview
I was tasked to build a svg logo generator which gives you specific parameters to ask what you would like to choose from as well as asking for input.

## Features
Shape Selection: Choose from a variety of shapes including circles, squares, and triangles.
Customization: Customize the color and size of each shape.
Text Embedding: Add text to your logo within a specified character limit.
File Generation: Export your logo as an SVG file.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the cloned directory and run npm install.
Usage
To use the logo generator, execute the node index.js command in your terminal. Follow the prompts to select the shape, enter text, and specify colors and dimensions for your logo. Once completed, the tool will generate an SVG file with your custom logo.

## Example usage:

$ node index.js
? What shape would you like? Circle
? Enter at most three characters: ABC
? What color would you like for the shape? blue
? What color would you like for the text? white
? What is the diameter of the circle?  300
? What is the name of the svg? mylogo.svg
Your svg has been created!
